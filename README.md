# Smart_Water_Monitor
A low-cost ESP32-based IoT device that monitors water quality and pipeline health in real time using TDS, pH, temperature, flow, and pressure sensors. It detects contamination and leakages using rule-based logic and sends instant alerts to a cloud/mobile dashboard for safe and efficient water management.
This project presents an ESP32-based IoT system designed for continuous water quality and pipeline health monitoring. It integrates TDS, pH, temperature, flow, and pressure sensors to capture real-time data from a water line. The ESP32 processes these values using threshold-based logic to detect contamination, abnormal chemical levels, low pressure, or excessive flow patterns that indicate potential leakage. Sensor readings are transmitted through Wi-Fi to an MQTT/cloud dashboard, enabling live visualization, logging, and alert notifications. The system is low-cost, modular, and suitable for domestic and small-building installations, helping users prevent water wastage and maintain safe water standards.
